# Show-Segmentation-22

 This project is the continuation of past 3 years GSoC project and in my proposed approach, major problems with the algorithm can be solved, So I have decided to continue the show segmentation project. Some of the anchors are misinterpreted, leading us to the wrong show name. There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation by up to 90%, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks.
