# Show-Segmentation-22

 We are already getting segmented shows from the past year's algorithm. We need to focus on improving accuracy and time complexity now. The results from the previous algorithm are pretty similar to Paul's manually annotated spreadsheet shared by Tim. In my proposed approach, major problems with the algorithm can be solved, So I have decided to continue the show segmentation project. Some of the anchors are misinterpreted, leading us to the wrong show name. There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks.
